# Collector

This app allows me to keep tracking of my collection of movies and TV shows.

Looking at this project, I want you to focus on my way of working and thinking, rather than on its complexity. I'll try to show you how I organize my code and will document whatever decisions I make, either with commit messages and/or with inline comments.
